# Compute Active time Interval during DFS（时间戳）

## Problem

Given an undirected graph, for every vertex, compute the starting time and finishing time during a DFS.

## Input

The first line is the number of test cases.

For every test case, the first line is the number of node n, meaning nodes are 1,2,...,n.

The next line is the number of edges m, then m lines are followed, where each line is in the form of u v, meaning (u,v) is an undirected edge.

## Output

For each test case, print the starting and finishing time for every vertex, suppose we always starting a DFS from the smallest numbered vertex. For example, the output might look like

```
1:1-2
2:3-4
3:5-6
---
```

1. Suppose we always start a DFS from the smallest numbered vertex, and choose the smallest numbered adjacent vertex.
2. The starting time is 1.
3. Print a dash-line after each test case.

## Sample Input

```
2

3
1
3 2

3
2 1
3 1
3 2
```

## Sample Output

```
1:1-2
2:3-6
3:4-5
---
1:1-6
2:2-5
3:3-4
---
```

## Note

1. You must not write only the main function.
2. You must not use global variables.
3. To match the output, make sure your adjacent list is ordered.

# Can I Post the letter

## 题目描述

I am a traveler. I want to post a letter to Merlin. But because there are so many roads I can walk through, and maybe I can’t go to Merlin’s house following these roads, I must judge whether I can post the letter to Merlin before starting my travel. Suppose the cities are numbered from 0 to N-1, I am at city 0, and Merlin is at city N-1. And there are M roads I can walk through, each of which connects two cities. Please note that each road is direct, i.e. a road from A to B does not indicate a road from B to A. Please help me to find out whether I could go to Merlin’s house or not.

## 输入描述

There are multiple input cases. For one case, first are two lines of two integers N and M, (N<=200, M<=N*N/2), that means the number of citys and the number of roads. And Merlin stands at city N-1. After that, there are M lines. Each line contains two integers i and j, what means that there is a road from city i to city j.  
The input is terminated by N=0.

## 输出描述

For each test case, if I can post the letter print “I can post the letter” in one line, otherwise print “I can't post the letter”.

# Euler Euler

## Description:

Given an undirected graph G, decide whether  
G has an Euler Circuit, Euler Path, or neither.

## Input:

There are multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer T, indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers, 1 <= n <= 1000 and 1 <= m  
<= n*(n-1)/2, where n is the number of nodes (numbered from 1 to n) and m is the number of edges. In the following m lines, each line has two integers indicating two adjacent nodes of an edge.

## Output:

For each test case, print a string “Euler Circuit”, “Euler Path”, or “Neither”.

# Ordering Tasks（拓扑排序）

## 题目描述

John has n tasks to do. Unfortunately, the tasks are not independent and the execution of one task is only possible if other tasks have already been executed.

## 输入描述

There are multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer T, indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers, 1 <= n <= 100000 and 1 <= m <= 100000. n is the number of tasks (numbered from 1 to n) and m is the number of direct precedence relations between tasks. After this, there will be m lines with two integers i and j, representing the fact that task i must be executed before task j. It is guaranteed that no task needs to be executed before itself either directly or indirectly.

## 输出描述

For each test case, print a line with n integers representing the tasks in a possible order of execution. To separate them, print exactly one space after each integer. If there are multiple solutions, output the smallest one by lexical order.

# Highways（最大生成树）

## 题目描述

The island nation of Flatopia is perfectly flat. Unfortunately, Flatopia has no public highways. So the traffic is difficult in Flatopia. The Flatopian government is aware of this problem. They're planning to build some highways so that it will be possible to drive between any pair of towns without leaving the highway system.  
Flatopian towns are numbered from 1 to N. Each highway connects exactly two towns. All highways follow straight lines. All highways can be used in both directions. Highways can freely cross each other, but a driver can only switch between highways at a town that is located at the end of both highways.  
The Flatopian government wants to minimize the length of the longest highway to be built. However, they want to guarantee that every town is highway-reachable from every other town.

## 输入描述

This problem contains multiple test cases!  
The first line of a multiple input is an integer T, then a blank line followed by T input blocks. Each input block is in the format indicated in the problem description. There is a blank line between input blocks.  
For each case, the first line is an integer N (3 <= N <= 500), which is the number of villages. Then come N lines, the i-th of which contains N integers, and the j-th of these N integers is the distance (the distance should be an integer within [1, 65536]) between village i and village j.

## 输出描述

The output format consists of T output blocks. There is a blank line between output blocks.  
For each case, you should output a line contains an integer, which is the length of the longest road to be built such that all the villages are connected, and this value is minimum.

# 最大生成森林

## 题目描述：

对连通图进行遍历，过程中所经过的边和顶点的组合可看做是一棵普通树，通常称为生成树。

而连通图的所有生成树中边权重和最大的那棵生成树即为最大生成树。

对于非连通图而言，多个连通分量对应的多棵生成树就构成了整个非连通图的生成森林。

而最大生成森林的定义就是在非连通图中，所有连通分量对应的最大生成树之和。

因此我们给定一个无向图 G，它可能是一个非连通图的，你的任务是找到最大生成森林。

## 输入：

可能有多个测试用例。第一行是测试用例数目。

对于每个测试用例，第一行包含两个整数 n，m（1<=n<=1000，0<=m<=n*（n-1）/2），其中 n 是图中的顶点数，m 是边数。

接下来的 m 行，每行有三个整数 x，y，d（0<=x，y<=n-1 和 d>0），这意味着有一个无向边（x，y），代价为 d。

## 输出：

对于每个测试用例，输出最大生成森林的值。

# All pairs shortest path（最短路）

## 题目描述

N cities named with numbers 1 ... N are connected with one-way roads. For each pair of cities i and j, you need to find the shortest path from city i to city j.

## 输入描述

The first line contains three integers N, K and Q (2<=N<=100, 1<=K<=10000, 1<=Q<=10000). N is the number of cities, K is the number of roads, and Q is the number of queries. Each of following K lines contains three  
integers i, j, d (1<=i,j<=N, 0<d<10000), indicates there is a road from city i to city j, and its length is d. The next Q lines describes the queries, each line contains two integers i and j (1<=i,j<=N).

## 输出描述

For each query, you need to print the shortest path in one line. If there is no path between the query cities pair, you should print "-1".

# Robot（最短路）

## 题目描述

Karell Incorporated has designed a new exploration robot that has the ability to explore new terrains, this new robot can move in all kinds of terrain, it only needs more fuel to move in rough terrains, and less fuel in plain terrains. The only problem this robot has is that it can only move orthogonally, the robot can only move to the grids that are at the North, East, South or West of its position.  
The Karell`s robot can communicate to a satellite dish to have a picture of the terrain that is going to explore, so it can select the best route to the ending point, The robot always choose the path that needs the minimum fuel to complete its exploration, however the scientist that are experimenting with the robot, need a program that computes the path that would need the minimum amount of fuel. The maximum amount of fuel that the robot can handle is 9999 units.  
The Terrain that the robot receives from the satellite is divided into a grid, where each cell of the grid is assigned to the amount of fuel the robot would need to pass thought that cell. The robot also receives the starting and ending coordinates of the exploration area.

## 输入描述

The first line of the input file is the number of tests that must be examined.  
The first line of the test is the number of rows and columns that the grid will contain. The rows and columns will be 0 < row ≤100, 0 < column ≤ 100.  
The next lines are the data of the terrain grid.  
The last line of the test has the starting and ending coordinates.

## 输出描述

One line, for each test will have the amount of fuel needed by the robot.
